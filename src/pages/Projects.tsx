            Learn fundamental computer science algorithms by playing a fun game! Race against a computer to complete the steps of a sorting algorithm. Only by completing the steps of the algorithm correctly can you score points.
            There are two primary gamemodes: Race and Endless. 

            <p>
                In Race, you and the computer race to sort a certain number of arrays before the other. This mode is considerably easier than Endless.
            </p>

            <p>
            In Endless, the game ends when the computer overtakes you, which can either be after 5 arrays or 50. The caveat is that everytime you complete an array, the computer speeds up.
            When you inevitably lose, you can compare with other users on our leaderboard system to see how you did.

            This project came in two parts: A simulated CPU and an assembly language to go with it. 
            Based on the ARM architecture, the CPU was constructed in Logisim evolution and consisted of 8 general purpose 64-bit registers.
            It doesn't have pipelining, but it does have full branching support. It uses a 32-bit instruction set for its instructions, which are generated by the custom assembler.

            <p>
                The assembly language is based loosely on ARMv8 assembly. However, the names of the instructions have been changed to dog themed ones (the project is named after my dog). 
                The assembler is written entirely in Python, and outputs a text file compatible with Logisim memory.

            CS Games is a bi-yearly event hosted by the Computer Science club at Stevens Institute of Technology. 
            It's essentially a puzzle competition where teams of 3 compete to solve a series of puzzles first. To host the games, we needed a web platform to accomodate the puzzles themself (as many of them were programming-based).
            
            <p>
                There was a previous website used by the club, however, it became unavailable to use shortly before the games were set to take place.
                Thus, I took it upon myself to build a new website that was capable of handling 200+ concurrent users. 
                Users are able to create and join teams, and different team members can play across different devices and their results will be shared.

            A compiler for converting relational algebraic expresions to an executable file that will give the result of the expression (or query).       
            Compiler was specifically designed to compile a new &Phi; (Phi) operator that allows for a complete decoupling of aggregates and "group by" clauses. 
            For more information on this, the you can check out <LinkButton link="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/787619">this paper</LinkButton>.
            <p>
                This project was written entirely in Vanilla C and is capable of running on any platform with a C compiler. 
                For data entry, it uses csv files, and for query entry it can either read a file or there is a command line interface option. 
                By leveraging C's inherit speed and efficiency, the queries are able to run incredibly quickly. 
                Additionally, a very light extension was created for VSCode that adds syntax highlighting and completion for the new &Phi; operator.
            </p>
        </>,
        features: <ul>
            <li>Constructs a compilable C file that will run the given query, precomputing information such as the maximum number of rows to save memory resources when running.</li>
            <li>Helpful CLI to guide users with explanations of the different parts of the query.</li>
            <li>VSCode extension that adds syntax highlighting and basic code completion.</li>
